# Virtual Apparel Trial 
Capstone project: Image-Recognition 

Virtual trial room is the technological innovation in the fashion industry. “Try before you buy” worked years ago for efficient customer engagement in outfit stores. Now the concept is gradually being replaced via virtual trial rooms which let customers try clothes virtually that translates into eliminating long queues and waiting periods in front of trail rooms. 
The customer simply poses and the camara will or upload the photo track depth to align virtual clothes on it. Cuts, creases and movement of virtual clothes can be witnessed from the render as its lighting intensity is adapted to match ambient lighting conditions. For much close to real-life experience, we do add the use of full user pose tracking and models along with cloth simulation of 2D images.
